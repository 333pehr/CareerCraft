ATS scans each resume for keywords, skills, experience, and other criteria set by the hiring team to determine which candidates best match the job requirements. An ATS-friendly resume is one that is formatted and optimized to be easily read and understood by these systems. This includes using clear headings, avoiding complex layouts or images, and incorporating relevant keywords from the job description. By creating an ATS-friendly resume, applicants increase their chances of passing the initial screening and being noticed by hiring managers.",
